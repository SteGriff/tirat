How hard can it be to write a key-value store that maps one value to another?

- This app uses sqlite but you can power your apps with [a number of other storage options](https://glitch.com/storage)
- `sqlite.db` is created and put into the `.data` folder, a hidden directory whose contents arenâ€™t copied when a project is remixed. You can see the contents of `.data` in the console under "Logs"
- To save to the database, remix this app!

On the front-end,

- Edit `views/index.html`, `public/style.css`, and `public/client.js`

On the back-end,

- The app starts at `server.js`
- Add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- Safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)
